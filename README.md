# Train Scheduler

Train scheduler is an app that allows users to create fictional train schedules. The user fills out a form that requests the train name, destination, first train time, and frequency. Once entered, the data is stored in Firebase. The user has the option to delete and update trains. The arrival time, frequency and minutes away is calculated using MomentJS.
